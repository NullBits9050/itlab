  <h3><strong>	About Pubg Mobile	</strong></h3>
  <p><blockquote><abbr title="PUBG">	The world online has exploded into <mark>Battle Royale</mark> madness, with the launch of a couple of huge games. One is Fortnite and the other is <q>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds	</q>	, or PUBG to its friends. 

We've talked about Fortnite separately: that game is similar to PUBG, but Epic - the game's developer - describes it as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, as there's a building element to it, which doesn't come into <span style="background-color:yellow">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</span>	.

The important thing about these huge titles is that they are now both mobile games - hence PUBG Mobile - as well as being available across other platforms.</abbr></blockquote></p>
